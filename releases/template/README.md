# Device Name &bull; Operating System &bull; Identifier

* Duplicate the template directory and name it after your release.
* Release describes a known good configuration. Find the latest commit in Nexmon_CSI master which works reliably on your setup and enter it's details here.
* For example, Commit b52fca works reliably on Raspberry Pi 3B+ running Raspbian Buster with kernel v4.19.97. So I should add that commit hash and it's date: January 30 2020 here.
