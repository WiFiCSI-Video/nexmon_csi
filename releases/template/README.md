Duplicate the template directory and name it after your release.
Releases describe a known good configuration. Find the latest commit in Nexmon_CSI master which works reliably on your setup and enter it's details here.

For example, Commit b52fca3abc18715d6d12692e531164b5d62a78fd works reliably on Raspberry Pi 3B+ running Raspbian Buster with kernel v4.19.97. So I should add that commit hash and it's date: January 30 2020 here.

Commit: commit hash
Date: Date of commit
